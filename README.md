## About mongoose-plugins-accessible-by

WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT YET RELEASED

A simple plugin that adds an accessibleBy field to a mongoose schema to be
able to determine access rights for models belonging to this schema.

Caveat:

This plugin is designed for systems where you do not need to browse over large
collections and filter by access rights. If you need that you would have to put
in some extra work.

## Install

npm install mongoose-plugins-accessible-by

## Contributing to mongoose-plugins-accessible-by
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the package.json, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
